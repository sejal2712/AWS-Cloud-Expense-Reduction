The Lambda function fetches all EBS (Elastic Block Storage) snapshots and also retrieves a list of active EC2 instances (running and stopped). For each snapshot, it checks if the associated volume (if exists) is associated with any active instance or not. If it finds a stale snapshot, it deletes it, effectively optimizing storage costs.
